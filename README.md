# The Orphan
___

The Orphan is a short visual novel made in the span of 2 days. It was made in Ren'py and is based on the concepts of humanity, sacrifice, death, amoung other thought provoking prompts. This was made in Hackclub's Seattle Daydream event. In this game we, Tianhe, Dhriti, and Dhanya, attempted to evoke emotions, some of which words cannot describe. The ones that can be pinpointed include (but are not limited to) grief, nostalgia, and fear. Although some may describe our game as gory, we strongly believe that the pixelated nature, censored parts, and unrealistic art style are able to highlight the dark parts of humanity while also not scaring the viewer.

Please ask yourself this question when playing/reading, how are you like Lucy?
